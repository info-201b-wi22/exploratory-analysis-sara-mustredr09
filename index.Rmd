### Abstract

Our team is interested in exploring the correlation between high school students’ race and their high school graduation rates in Washington. As part of the differences that we observe in the educational outcomes among different racial groups, we also want to find out other factors that could help explain these outcomes or correlate with them, such as Washington students’ involvement with the criminal justice system.

### Keywords

Race, demographic data, educational attainment, high school completion, criminal justice system

### Introduction  

Education has always been one of the most concerning topics among the world. It is good to see that the educational attainment of the whole population has increased for the past few years. However, differences and gaps between the races still remain, or even worse, grow. In contemporary society, educational attainment could be one of the vital determinants of a person’s future path. To put it into the specific scenario, a decent education could help the person to have better job opportunities and the possibility to apply for higher wages. Beyond the economic elements, those who fail to graduate from high school are more likely to have health problems, worse housing, unhappy families, etc., compared with those who are “highly educated.”

If a person’s future is highly dependent on his/her educational attainment, and it would be affected by some demographic reasons; In other words, one’s future is determined by his/her ethnicity. The injustice a person will undergo is formed since his/her birth. As a bad consequence, it is undeniable that many situations like this would make people be disappointed and less confident about the meaning of education. Therefore, by focusing on Washington State, we would like to explore how demographic elements affect the educational result for high school students, the level that race is connected to high schoolers’ criminal justice system, and how they influence the educational outcomes when they are combined. Hopefully, it is possible to see if there is anything we can do to alleviate such inequality and the negative outcomes it brings.

### Related Work  

Our team is researching the correlation between high school students’ race, their involvement with the criminal justice system and their educational outcomes to better understand the quantitative data behind sociological research and articles that discuss how punitive policies in K-12 public schools disproportionately affect students of color. *Police and punitive policies make schools less safe, especially for minority students*, an article written by Washington Post journalist  Kathryn Schumaker, discusses how especially
> “Black students [and students of color] are [much more likely to be suspended](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/17/8255), expelled or arrested at school than white students…[mostly for minor infractions](https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/resources/projects/center-for-civil-rights-remedies/school-to-prison-folder/federal-reports/out-of-school-and-off-track-the-overuse-of-suspensions-in-american-middle-and-high-schools) such as disrupting class or tardiness as opposed to criminal or violent behavior.” (Riddle and Sinclair, 2019) (Center for Civil Rights Remedies, 2019)

Research of this nature has developed new terms to define this social phenomena, such as the *school-to-prison pipeline* [(Heitzeg, 2009)](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ870076.pdf). In her article Education Or Incarceration: Zero Tolerance Policies And The School To Prison Pipeline”, St. Catherine University professor Nancy A. Heitzeg defines the *school-to-prison pipeline* as a “growing pattern of tracking students out of educational institutions, primarily via ―zero tolerance policies, and tracking them directly and/or indirectly into the juvenile and adult criminal justice systems.”

The *school-to-prison pipeline* disproportionately affects marginalized communities such as low-income youth, students with disabilities, and youth of color, especially Black students. Black students are suspended and expelled at the highest rates, despite the lack of evidence to prove that Black students are more likely to misbehave under the same circumstances as their counterparts [(Witt, 2007)](https://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-070924discipline-story.html).

### The Dataset

__Source__: [Juvenile Justice Dashboard - HS Completion](https://data.wa.gov/Education/Juvenile-Justice-Dashboard-HS-Completion/ej5m-hutb)

__Data Collection Method__: The Education Research and Data Center, an organization that collects data about Washington students, collected this data through demographic research and from data provided by multiple higher education institutions and groups, such as the OSPI P210 Enrollment Summary for information about high school graduates.

__Purpose of Data Collection__: The data was collected to provide information about secondary education outcomes for students who were involved in the criminal justice system.

__Number of Observations__: 921

__Number of Features__: 7

__Ethical Questions/Questions of Power__:
- Are there international students in this data set who do not have records of graduation or a GED who are considered dropouts?
- Are certain students left out who could have been included with a bit more research/structuring of the dataset?
- In considering where the data from this specific dataset came from, how did the higher education institutions and groups collect their data? Are there any limitations or drawbacks in the methods that they are using?

__Limitations of the Dataset__:
- Some of the values are blurred out to protect students’ identities, so it might skew the results. These might translate to N/A values in RStudio, so any function we use will need to exclude those values.
- The data for students whose gender falls into the \'x\' category is inconsistently recorded, which could result in inaccurate representation of this group.

### Summary Information

Write a summary paragraph of findings that includes the 5 values calculated from your summary information R script


### Table

```{r, echo = FALSE, code = readLines("Table.R")}
```

We chose to include this table because it demonstrates a pattern of our dataset over time. It shows the percentages of each race/ethnic group who received a high school diploma and were not justice involved.

### Chart 1

```{r, echo = FALSE, code = readLines("Chart1.R")}
```

We wanted to demonstrate the changes over time for the high school outcomes for different types of justice involvement. These graphs show the percent for each high school outcome (GED, diploma, and dropout) for each type of justice involvement within different years.

### Chart 2

Include a chart

Describe why you chose this chart and what information it reveals

I chose to do this chart because it shows the percentage (slope) of students that graduated with a high school diploma based on their demographic values, and it is calculated per year. These values include race, sex, and all other unspecified values.

### Chart 3

```{r, echo = FALSE, code = readLines("Chart3.R)}
```

Demosntrates the average dropout rate per justice involvement category
